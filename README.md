# stv-dcs-kneeboards
Collection of kneeboards to help with DCS World.

## Installation
Depending on the version of DCS you use, place the "Kneeboard" folder in:
* Steam (Release), Steam (Open Beta) or Standalone (Release) version:
    `%homepath%\Saved Games\DCS`
* Standalone (Open Beta) version:
    `%homepath%\Saved Games\DCS.OpenBeta`
* Standalone (Open Alpha) version:
    `%homepath%\Saved Games\DCS.OpenAlpha`

## Change Kneeboard Page Order
The pages can be reordered - the order they appear in the kneeboard is alphabetically A-Z, so the images can be renamed to change their order.
